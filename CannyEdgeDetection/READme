CANNY EDGE DETECTİON WİTH MATLAB 

This is a algorithm for edge detection. 
There is 5 steps. 

1-Convert to image Gray Scale (this is made with grayScalePic.m function)
2- Apply to Gaussian Filter to image (this is made with gaussianFilt.m function)
  * My gaussian filter function needs sigma and kernel value.
3- Calculating the Image Gradient (This is made with imageGrad.m function) 
  * After this function will calculate dx and dy of image, function finds the magnitude and theta value of image through dx and dy. 
4- Non-Maximum Supression (This is made with nonMaxSup.m function)
5- Thresholding (This is made with thresholding.m function) 
  * Upper and lower value will be given. 

All steps will be applied to the image step by step.
I will upload Medium Blog for this, and then it will be more understandable. 
Thanks. 
Good code.
